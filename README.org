#+TITLE: Hi!
#+DESCRIPTION: am a middle school student and wannabe programmer.I know C and Rust. And I am currently learning Rust, Typescript, elisp, and Java (courtesy of my school).My main interest lies in tinkering with low level stuff like Operating systems, and i enjoy writing backends as well.In the mean time i am procrastinating on doing these things, I like to work on my emacs configuration and configure my desktop.speaking of emacs, I love emacs to an extent so much, i basically live inside of emacs at this point. Still need to practice my lisp-fu thoughyou can reach me via my email: muhil.sathish_kofee@yahoo.com, or my discord: kofee#5614
