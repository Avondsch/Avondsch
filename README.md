## Hello!ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior high student who enjoys declarative and verbose programming. I use Rust and C as my primary languages, and i also use typescript along the way if needed. I am an emacs evangelist, I love the emacs ecosystem and its extensibility as a program. In that regard i also like emacs lisp and common lisp, scheme / guile are still in the works :). I am also an avid Gahnu/Linuwux (linux) user, and I use NixOS as my distribution of choice at the moment. Please do not consider me a Nix master by any means, i am still getting a feel of it. I am currently learning C++, Rust and Nix.  As for my other interests i like math, 80s and 90s rap music, anime/manga, and staying in my room.
