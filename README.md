## Hi!

I am Muhil Sathish Kumar, a high-school student from India. I do a lot of things from programming, mathermatics, physics, and photography. 
I hail GNU emacs as my absolute tool for everything, and so far i havent regretted my desicion to delve into the emacs rabbit hole (I am totally saying this without a gun to my head). 

Anyways,

here are the tools i use, currently i am learning Python, Rust, and Haskell:

Keep in mind that programming is a hobby for me, and as such this github wont be extremely maintained as other githubs usually are. There will be one moment of epiphany every 3 or so months for me to come back to programming, and in that case you will see even more empty repos and unfinished projects :)
