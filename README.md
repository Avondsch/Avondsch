## Hello!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Muhil, I am a junior high student living in India. I love programming and experimentation, especially tinkering with low level intricacies. My primary language of choice is rust, and i do know C/C++ and Typescript. I am an emacs enjoyer as well, and love emacs lisp and lisp in general. Currently i am learning Java, clojure, and emacs (you never stop learning emacs). I love linux (no i will not call it Gahnu/linux), so much so that i havent touched a windows computer in over 3 years now. I use NixOS as my distro of choice, sometimes i do end up in fedora or gentoo linux.

Technologies i use:
