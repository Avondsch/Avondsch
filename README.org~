* Hi!

I am Muhil, a high school student from India who is into Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.

Here, you will find many of my unfinished projects, or sometimes even unstarted projects because I simply have no time to start working on them
(A boy can only dream in a world of JEE prep).

** Languages I use are (In their Decreasing order of familiarity):
1. Rust
   2. Java
      3. C / C++
	 4. Common Lisp
	    5. Haskell
	       6. Python
		  7. Julia


** Tools I use:
1. GNU Emacs (Vanilla)
   2. Nix / NixOS
      3. Yeah that's pretty much it, once you have emacs, you dont need anything else.
