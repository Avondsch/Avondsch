* Hi!

I am Muhil, a high school student from India who is into Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.

Here, you will find many of my unfinished projects, or sometimes even unstarted projects because I simply have no time to start working on them
(A boy can only dream in a world of JEE prep).

** Languages I use are (In their Decreasing order of familiarity):
 Rust
 Java
 C / C++
 Common Lisp
 Haskell
 Python
 Julia


** Tools I use:
GNU Emacs (Vanilla)
Nix / NixOS
Yeah that's pretty much it, once you have emacs, you dont need anything else.
